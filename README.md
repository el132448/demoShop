## FRONTEND

## Deployment

## Note from Chatgpt
✅ 1. Basic Functionality Works
 Add to cart

 Update quantity

 Calculate subtotal and total

 Checkout POST request

 Order saving to DB with stock reduction

You're doing well here. ✅

✅ 2. Frontend-Backend Integration
 React sends correct JSON

 Flask correctly parses request.get_json()

 Response codes (200, 400, 500) are handled

 Errors shown to user (not just console log)

👉 Add user-friendly error display (e.g., show data.error in a modal or alert() instead of generic "Something went wrong").

🔐 3. Security & Validation
 Auth: Currently hardcoded user_id = 1 — you’ll need to:

Use login / session or JWT

Restrict user-specific data

 Input validation:

Prevent negative quantity

Handle malformed requests

 Rate limiting / CSRF protection (especially for public deployment)

🛠️ 4. Environment Setup
 Config file for environment variables:

FLASK_ENV, DATABASE_URL, etc.

 Switch API base URL from http://localhost:5000 to dynamic (/api or .env based)

 Use Proxy in React or CORS config in Flask for deployment

🚀 5. Deployment Setup
 Frontend build: npm run build

 Backend WSGI server (like Gunicorn)

 Serve frontend via:

Flask static files OR

Separate server (like Vercel/Netlify) + connect via API

🧪 6. Testing
 Manual test: create, checkout, error handling

 Optional: Write unit tests for backend logic (stock check, total calculation)

 Console logs cleaned up (React + Flask)

💾 7. Database
 Is your DB production-ready? (e.g., PostgreSQL on RDS / Railway / Supabase)

 Is initial data seeded? (e.g., sample products)

 DB migration tool like Flask-Migrate used?

✅ Final Thoughts
You're about 90% there — the core features work, and the checkout logic is sound. Here’s what I'd recommend before deploying:

🔧 Top Priorities Before Deployment:
Fix hardcoded user_id

Error handling UX

Deployment server setup (build frontend + use WSGI server)

Secure DB config / env setup

If you want, I can help you:

Bundle frontend + backend for deployment (e.g., Docker or Flask serving React)

Set up on platforms like Render, Railway, Heroku, or EC2

Add login system or test payment stub
